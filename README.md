# Housing-Prices-Statistical-Analysis

# Overview

The goal of this project is to practice statistical analysis using the iterative data analysis process. For this project, I use this Housing Prices dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). 

The goal of the analysis is to identify the most important features of houses that affect the sale prices.

# Methodology

I apply data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, and various statistical analysis methods - more specifically:

1. Explore data and understand what the fields mean.
2. Examine the relationships between the sales price and other features in the dataset. Use data visualization techniques to help you gain intuitive understanding of the relationships.
3. Make informed guess on which features should be investigated in depth.
4. Data cleaning & manipulation.
5. Presentation of findings in statistical summary and/or data visualizations.
